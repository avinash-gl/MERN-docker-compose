# üö¢ Dockerized MERN Stack App

This project is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose.


**Tech Stack Used**

- **Application**: MERN
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose

**Note:** This project was built to practice Docker and Docker Compose by containerizing a MERN stack application and setting up multi-service orchestration.


## üõ†Ô∏è Learnings

- Writing Dockerfiles for frontend (React) and backend (Node.js)
- Creating and using a custom Docker bridge network
- Using Docker Compose to orchestrate multi-container apps
- Connecting Node backend to MongoDB container
- Mapping ports between host and containers
- Using `volumes` for MongoDB data persistence
- Running and debugging containers with `docker-compose logs`

**Docker and Docker Compose File**

- Frontend:

```text
FROM node:18.9.1

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json .

RUN npm install 

COPY . /app

EXPOSE 5173

CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```

- Backend:

```text
FROM node:18.9.1

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json .

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 5050

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

- docker-compose.yml

```text
version: "3.8"

services:

  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./mern/frontend
